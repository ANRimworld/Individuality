# Individuality

### Adds new traits, rebalances vanilla traits and allows pawns to have randomized stats.
	
Pawns will now have a random body weight, random psychic sensitivity (replaces the corresponding traits), random confidence (chance they try to romance others) and a random sexuality (replaces gay trait and includes bisexual).
Sexuality commonalities can be changed in the settings. Want everyone to be bi or gay? -> Settings!

The amount of traits pawns spawn with can be modified in the settings. This setting is instant, meaning all future pawns will spawn with the set amount of traits (no restarting necessary) - can even be changed while in game. (Woo Transpiler magic)
	
The goal is to make most traits have up- and downsides, not equally however, meaning there are still good and bad traits. Some traits that are just slightly bad/good will not have an up/downside added (like kind, creepy breathing etc.).

Pyromaniac, Chemical Interest and Chemical Fascination have gotten a brand new mechanic: Random Inspirations. Pawns with these traits get inspirations regularly independent of their mood. 

The new traits are mostly work-related traits that make pawns better in one area and worse in another. Generally the improvement is bigger than the penalty, so they can be considered good traits.
